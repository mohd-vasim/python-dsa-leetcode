### **1. Sum of N Even Natural Numbers**

Problem Description:

You are given an integer n. Your task is to calculate and return the sum of the first n even natural numbers. The even natural numbers are: 2, 4, 6, 8, ...



Input:

A single integer n where 1 <= n <= 10^4.



Output:

Return the sum of the first n even natural numbers.



Example:

Input: n = 3
Output: 12  # (2 + 4 + 6)
 
Input: n = 5
Output: 30  # (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)


### **2. Check for Even Number**
Problem Description:

You are given an integer n. Your task is to check whether the number is even or not. Return True if the number is even, and False otherwise.



Input:

A single integer n where -10^9 <= n <= 10^9.



Output:

Return True if n is an even number, otherwise return False.



Example:

Input: n = 4
Output: True
 
Input: n = 7
Output: False


### **3. Check for Prime Number**
Problem Description:

You are given an integer n. Your task is to check whether the number is prime or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Return True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.



Input:

A single integer n where 1 <= n <= 10^6.



Output:

Return True if n is a prime number, otherwise return False.



Example:

Input: n = 5
Output: True
 
Input: n = 4
Output: False


### **4. Valid Perfect Square**

Problem Description:

You are given a positive integer num. Your task is to check whether num is a perfect square or not. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, ...). Return True if num is a perfect square, and False otherwise.



Input:

A single positive integer num where 1 <= num <= 10^9.



Output:

Return True if num is a perfect square, otherwise return False.



Example:

Input: num = 16
Output: True
 
Input: num = 14
Output: False


### **5. Decimal to Binary**

Problem Description:

You are given an integer n. Your task is to return its binary representation as a string. Do not use any built-in functions for conversion.



Input:

A single integer n, where -10^9 <= n <= 10^9.



Output:

A string representing the binary representation of n.



Example:

Input: n = 5
Output: "101"
 
Input: n = -5
Output: "-101"


### **6. Binary to Decimal**

Problem Description:

You are given a string binary_str representing a binary number. Your task is to convert this binary string to its corresponding decimal integer. Do not use any built-in functions for conversion.



Input:

A string binary_str, consisting of characters '0' and '1', where the length of the string is between 1 and 30 (inclusive).



Output:

An integer representing the decimal value of the binary string



Example:

Input: binary_str = "101"
Output: 5
 
Input: binary_str = "1101"
Output: 13

### **7. GCD of Two Numbers**

Problem Description:

You are given two integers n and m. Your task is to find the GCD of these two numbers. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Do not use any built-in functions and do not use recursion.



Input:

Two integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 10^9.



Output:

An integer representing the GCD of n and m.



Example:

Input: n = 48, m = 18
Output: 6
 
Input: n = 56, m = 98
Output: 14
